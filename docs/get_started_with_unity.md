# Get started with Unity

## What is Unity ?
Unity is a software used mainly to develop games, it supports scripting in many programming languages, in our case we use C# for scripting. <br>
Unity has a great documentation so we may link offen to their documentation.

## Download Unity and familiarize youtself with it
I recommend downloading Unity Hub then downloading whatever Unity version you want. <br>
The project currently uses Unity 2019.3.0f1, but you can basically use any newer version of Unity.
[download here Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download), you can also have a look at the [Unity installation guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingUnity.html)

You will then have to open the "sdsim" project, some more about it [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStarted.html)

If you never used unity before, there are few things you need to know before getting further into the documentation, familiarize yourself with the editor windows [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html)

You should now be ready to read the guides !
